# Stockin 📈

[Visit Live App](https://stockin.vercel.app)

Stockin is a simple, elegant stock portfolio tracker built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Supabase**. It allows users to search for stock tickers, track real-time prices, and manage their portfolio — all wrapped in a clean, modern UI powered by **Shadcn UI**.

This app was developed as a full-stack project to demonstrate my ability to build production-ready applications with modern technologies. It features server-side rendering, seamless database integration, and a beautiful, responsive user interface.
